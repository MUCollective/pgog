# Under construction: A Probabilistic Grammar of Graphics

<img src="https://xiaoyingpu.github.io/images/pgog-thumbnail.jpg" width="100">


This is an R package that accompanies our [CHI 2020 paper](https://osf.io/dy8qv/), _A Probabilistic Grammar of Graphics_ (PGoG). Here we implement the PGoG grammar as two `ggplot2` `geom`s and show that PGoG can be compatible with an existing grammar of graphics-based system. This package is intented as a prototype; not all valid PGoG specifications are supported.
